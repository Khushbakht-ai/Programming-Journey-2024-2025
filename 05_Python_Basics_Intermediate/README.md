# 🐍 Python Basics & Intermediate (Mar–Apr 2025)

This repository showcases my learning journey in Python, focused on building a solid foundation and covering intermediate concepts required for practical development and AI preparation.

I started learning Python in **March 2025** and practiced each concept through simple, clear programs. I finalized and uploaded this work to GitHub in **July 2025** as a personal milestone.
