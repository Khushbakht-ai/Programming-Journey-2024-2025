# 🧠 Python + C++ Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects developed during my foundational journey in Python and C++. Each project is designed to solve real-world problems through logic, automation, data handling, and file management. These practical exercises helped me build strong programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
