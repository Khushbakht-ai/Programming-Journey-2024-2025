# Programming Journey (Oct 2024 â€“ May 2025) ðŸš€

This repository documents my 8-month self-driven journey of learning **C++ and Python**, starting from basic syntax to building real-world mini projects using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and popular **Python libraries**.

The goal was clear: build a strong foundation in programming before formally beginning my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

## ðŸ§­ Note on Learning Timeline

Between January and March, I was also preparing for the SAT alongside programming. While that naturally slowed down my pace a little, I stayed consistent and ensured I completed the core goals of my roadmap.

This journey wasnâ€™t just about speed â€” it was about depth, discipline, and building strong foundations for my future in AI.
