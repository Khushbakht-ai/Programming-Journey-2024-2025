# ðŸ’» Programming Journey (Oct 2024 â€“ May 2025) ðŸš€

This repository documents my **8-month self-driven journey** of learning C++ and Python â€” starting from the very basics and progressing to real-world mini projects using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and popular **Python libraries**.

> ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Build a strong programming foundation before formally beginning my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence (starting August 2025).

## ðŸ§  Learning Context

Between **January and early May 2025**, I was also preparing for the **SAT**, which I attempted on **May 3rd, 2025**, and scored **690/800 in Math**.

Balancing SAT prep with programming wasnâ€™t always easy â€” but it greatly sharpened my logic and focus.  
Though the pace was slower during this period, I stayed consistent and completed my roadmap goals with clarity.

> âœ¨ This journey wasnâ€™t about rushing â€” it was about **depth**, **discipline**, and building the kind of foundation that will last through my AI career.

- **Languages**: C++, Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

If you're also learning or exploring programming from scratch â€” I hope this gives you an idea of what steady, focused self-study can look like ðŸŒ±
